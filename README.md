# Project #3. Temperature Regulation:
# Discretizing a Digital Thermostat as a Dynamic Home Control System

● Specified output to be proportional to the accumulated error as derived from current and desired temperatures
● Incremented control effort required to supply voltage to the heating element by integrating error in time domain
● Composed block diagrams in Simulink to manage heat-transfer logic for the PI controller above a set-point of 22°C
