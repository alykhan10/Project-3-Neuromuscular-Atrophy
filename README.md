# Project #3: Neuromuscular Atrophy
# Quantifying the Effect of Signaling Pathways on Post-Workout Fatigue

● Configured 3 stimulus-delivering and recording electrodes to source electromyostimulation data from the forearm                   
● Performed stochastic sampling via LoggerPro to obtain inverse variance for neuromuscular stimulation and fatigue                 
● Sampled Creatine Kinase and C-Reactive Protein concentrations to establish a reduction in inflammatory response
