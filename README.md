# Project #3: Neuromuscular Atrophy
# Quantifying the Effect of Signaling Pathways on Post-Workout Fatigue

● Configured 3 stimulus-delivering and recording electrodes to source electromyostimulation data from the forearm           
● Conducted Fast-Fourier Transforms of frequencies in MATLAB after applying band-pass filter between 100-300 Hz          
● Performed stochastic sampling via LoggerPro to obtain inverse variance for neuromuscular stimulation and fatigue
